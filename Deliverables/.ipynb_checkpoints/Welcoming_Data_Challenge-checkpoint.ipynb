    "# I. Challenge Background\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, the reduction of greenhouse gases and in particular CO$_2$ emissions has become a major issue for all private and public actors. This is a key point if we hope to meet the objectives of the 2015 Paris Conference on Global Warming (COP21) to limit global warming between 1.5°C and 2°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, geopolitical issues have forced us to rethink our energy consumption to reduce our gas and electricity consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a 2021 study, buildings alone account for 44% of the energy consumed in France, ahead of the transport sector (31.3%). It is therefore crucial to understand which levers can be used to reduce the consumption of buildings and renovate them efficiently.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# II. Challenge goals\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "A real estate promotor wishing to predict the energy consumption of its real estate portfolio calls on you. In particular, he wishes to identify the variables that increase energy consumption by using the information in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric used to assess the ability to correctly predict energy consumption is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    $MAPE(y,\\hat{y})=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\frac{|y_i - \\hat{y_i}|}{max(\\epsilon,|y_i|)}$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>$\\epsilon$ is an arbitrary small yet strictly positive number to avoid undefined results when y is zero\n",
    "    <li>$y_i$ the real energy consumption\n",
    "    <li>$\\hat{y_i}$ the predicted energy consumption for the ith observation\n",
    "</ul>\n",
